# RNA-Seq-Analysis
#### Project Title: Expression analysis of KLHDC10, PLEKHD1, ZSWIM5, LRRC3B, AP006621.6, RP11-218M22.1, RP11-467J12.4, and CTD-3032H12.1 genes in breast cancer patients to find a potential biomarker for early detection of breast cancer progression and metastasis. 

Significance: The incidence of  BC is increasing day by day in my country according to recent data. In developing countries like Bangladesh, BC diagnosis has become a major problem due to a lack of healthcare facilities, skilled technicians, and a thorough understanding of cancer detection. A primary-stage BC diagnosis would have a significant impact on overall cancer treatment and could significantly reduce mortality rates. 

Aims: To assess the expression level of specific genes among patients and control respondents, to evaluate the association of expression level with incidence and prognosis, and to develop biomarkers for early breast cancer detection.
